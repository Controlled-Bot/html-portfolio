<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Burak — a video editor specializing in YouTube content, social media, and gaming videos.
I help creators, streamers, and businesses turn raw footage into structured, engaging,
and high-impact videos — from short-form content to long-form YouTube videos.</p>

<p>I’m currently studying Business Informatics while working as a freelance video editor. 
  My focus is on clean storytelling, fast-paced edits, subtitles, sound design, and a modern YouTube style.</p>

<p>Alongside video editing, I’m expanding into web development and continuously improving my skills to build modern, user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>My goal: create videos that don’t just look good, but keep viewers engaged and help channels grow.</p>
